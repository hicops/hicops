HiCOPS uses a standard CMake installation. Set the environment variables `CC` and `CXX` before executing CMake to specify the compilers. By default, HiCOPS enables `OpenMP` and `MPI` and disables instrumentation support. HiCOPS will search the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` for Timemory installation.

## Environment
* GCC 7.2+ compiler with C++14, OpenMP and threading
* MPI
* Python 3.7+
* CMake 3.11+
* Linux based OS such as Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS7+.

**Important**: Please make sure that your MPI distribution supports multiple threads (MPI thread multiple) option.

## Required Packages
Install all required packages by following the instructions [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation/packages#required-packages).

## Instrumentation Support
Optional: Install Timemory to enable instrumentation by following the instructions [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation/packages#optional-packages).

## Install HiCOPS
Install HiCOPS using Git & CMake using the following steps:

```bash
# clone
$ git clone https://github.com/mhaseeb123/hicops
$ cd hicops
$ mkdir build && cd build

# configure with CMake
$ CC=$(which gcc) CXX=$(which g++) cmake .. [CMAKE_OPTIONS] -G [BUILD_SYSTEM] [HICOPS_OPTIONS]

# build and install
$ make install -j [JOBS]

# append  hicops-core lib path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/../install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

**Note:** Compiling HiCOPS with Timemory enabled may take some time (~ 3-5 minutes)
