# Features

## Parallel Core Library
Parallel versions of many core algorithms along with necessary boiler-plate code has been implemented and available for faster development of new tools.

## Parallel Performance
Maximum usage of underlying resources with minimal overheads enable serious super-linear speedups in peptide identification speed.

## Seamless Integration
The generic workflow design allows any existing database peptide search algorithms such as data indexing algorithms, search algorithms, scoring algorithms, post-processing, data analytics algorithms to be easily integrated with HiCOPS. 

## Performance Analysis Support
Performance instrumentation and analysis (both macro and micro levels) has never been easier using simple template interfaces several metrics provided via [Timemory](https://github.com/NERSC/timemory.git).
