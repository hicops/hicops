# Features
Maximum usage of underlying resources with minimal overheads enable serious speedups in peptide identification speed. The generic workflow design allows any existing database peptide search algorithms such as data indexing algorithms, search algorithms, scoring algorithms, post-processing, data analytics algorithms to be easily integrated with HiCOPS. Parallel versions of many core algorithms along with necessary boiler-plate code has been implemented and available for faster development of new tools. Performance instrumentation and analysis (both macro and micro levels) has never been easier using simple template interfaces several metrics provided via [Timemory](https://github.com/NERSC/timemory.git).

## Limitations
Scale seamlessly in asymmetric multinode HPC systems. Offload algorithmic workload to GPUs, accelerators etc. Multi-language support
