## Parallel Core Design
The HiCOPS parallel core desig n is based onthe Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model and divides the database peptide search workflow in ***four*** supersteps. The algorithmic work in each superstep is executed in asynchronous parallel fashion and synchronization is performed between supersteps if required. The first superstep partitions the database in a load balanced fashion constructing partial databases. The second superstep preprocesses the experimental MS data in parallel. The third superstep performs the partial database peptide search producing intermediate results which are stored at the shared file system. The final superstep assembles the intermediate results yielding complete results which are written back to the shared file system. A high-level graphical design of HiCOPS supersteps is shown in the following figure.

Several optimization techniques including buffering, sampling, overlapped computations and communications and task scheduling are implemented to aid in optimal parallel performance. Further, the core library packs parallel versions of many core algorithms and the essential boiler-plate code for quicker development of new tools based on the discussed parallel design. Read more about the HiCOPS parallel design, its mathematical analysis and optimizations in our original research paper [here]().

## Performance
The proposed parallel design along with appropriate optimizations allow maximum utilization of underlying resources with minimal overheads enabling ultra-fast peptide search speeds. The highlights of performance evaluation results include:

* **Speedup vs Other tools:** More than 100x against all tools and up to 420x for large workloads compared to MSFragger.      
* **Parallel Efficiency:** 75-85% when the workload size is sufficiently large.     
* **Load Imabalance:** Less than 10%.    
* **Roofline:** Super-linear speedups with increasing nodes when the problem size is large.    
* **Comm/Compute Ratio:** Less than 5%.

## Performance Analysis Support
Performance analysis and instrumentation support has been provided at multiple levels via Timemory toolkit using C++14 `extern templates` allowing custom instantiation of only the required instrumentation components resulting in reduced compile times. Please refer to Timemory [README](https://github.com/NERSC/timemory#c-template-interface) on GitHub more information on the instrumentation interface. The instrumentation can be modified at pre-runtime using environment variable explained [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting_started#setup-instrumentation).

## Command-line Tools
HiCOPS provides several command-line tools for auxiliary purposes including database and experimental data preparation and extraction, post-processing results and runtime support. Please refer to [Tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools) for detailed information on tools.

## Integratability
The software design allows any existing or novel database peptide search algorithms such as data indexing algorithms, search algorithms, scoring algorithms, post-processing, data analytics algorithms to be easily integrated with HiCOPS. For more information on integration with HiCOPS, please refer to the [Integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting_started/integrate) document.
