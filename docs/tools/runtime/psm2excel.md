Command line tool that concatenates the peptide identification results written by HiCOPS as `TSV` files in the specified output directory, into a complete `Excel` file. The tool removes the partial TSV files as it processes them to clean the clutter.

Please make sure that the specified directory only contains the `TSV` files generated by ***ONLY*** one HiCOPS run. To make sure of that, please use a unique output directory for each HiCOPS run or first convert the `TSV` files into Excel before running another experiment with the same output directory.

$ $HICOPS_INSTALL/bin/tools/psm2excel -h
